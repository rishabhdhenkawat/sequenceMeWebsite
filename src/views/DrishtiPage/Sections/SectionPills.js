                        Mutations in our body are responsible for cancer. Some mutations might not guarantee but increase the chances of you developing cancer. The causes for cancer might be genetic, hereditary, or familial. However, most of the cancers are difficult to diagnose at early stages and difficult to cure at later ones. Sequence Me helps everyone get access to their genetic insights so that any such major disease is early diagnosed and can be easily cured.

                        85% of the human exome contains disease mutation information making it the fastest and best method to diagnose diseases. Some of the genetic mutations make us more prone to some diseases and thus dna sequencing can help us diagnose your dna for such disease risks so that early detection could help you get better treatment and as soon as possible. Some of the diseases are carried in our genes hereditarily. Sequence Me explores family history of genes as well as your unique mutations for various major diseases like Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Inflammatory Skin Disease, Influenza (Flu) Susceptibility, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Kidney Stones, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Psoriasis, Gallstone Disease, Glaucoma, Gout, and many more.
